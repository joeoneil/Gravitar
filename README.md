# Gravitar
A game made in C# for CSH Devcade over the course of a week, with the engine based on my previous game, [Lunar Lander](https://Github.com/joeoneil/LunarLander)

Based on the [1982 Arcade game by the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitar), this game functions similarly to LunarLander in that it uses the same customer vector graphics renderer, but is very different in that the code is a lot better.

This project was developed for [CSH Devcade](https://devcade.csh.rit.edu), which has a vertical ultrawide screen (this should explain the wacky aspect ratio)
